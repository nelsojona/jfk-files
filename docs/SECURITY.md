## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within the JFK Files Scraper project, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until it has been addressed by the maintainers.
   
2. **Send details of the vulnerability** by opening a new issue, marked as "[SECURITY]" and set to draft mode. Alternatively, contact the project maintainers directly via email if that information is provided in the repository.

3. **Provide detailed information** about the vulnerability, including:
   - The steps to reproduce the issue
   - The potential impact of the vulnerability
   - Any possible mitigations you've identified

4. **Allow time** for the maintainers to address the issue before any public disclosure.

## What to Expect

When you report a vulnerability, you can expect the following:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report as soon as possible, typically within 72 hours.

2. **Verification**: We will verify the vulnerability and determine its impact.

3. **Remediation**: We will develop and test a fix for the vulnerability.

4. **Release**: We will release the fix as soon as practical, depending on complexity.

5. **Public Disclosure**: After the vulnerability has been addressed, we will coordinate with you to determine an appropriate disclosure timeline.

## Responsible Disclosure

We encourage responsible disclosure to protect our users. We appreciate your help in keeping the JFK Files Scraper project and its users secure.

## Security Best Practices

When using this project, consider these security best practices:

1. **API Keys**: Never hardcode API keys in your code. Use environment variables or a secure key management system.

2. **Dependencies**: Keep all dependencies updated to their latest secure versions.

3. **Rate Limiting**: When scraping content, use appropriate rate limiting to avoid being blocked or potentially causing service disruptions.

4. **Data Storage**: Ensure any scraped data is stored securely and in accordance with relevant privacy regulations.

## Security Updates

Security updates will be published as new releases. We recommend always using the latest version of the JFK Files Scraper project.
