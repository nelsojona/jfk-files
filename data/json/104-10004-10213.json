The purpsse of this meeting was to discuss apparent inconsistencies -\nin material provided the Commission by CIA asd ty the Departmens of ;\nState which were called to our attention in a letter from the General :\nCounsel of the Cummission to Mr. Helms, dated 3 July 1964. :\n2. By way of introduction, Mr. Slawson said that in the portion of the | -\nCommission's report that he was writing, he sould have to deal with the 7\nquestion of whett.er or not the OSWALDs! depzrture {rom the USSR = and ;\n‘the circumstances {i.e. timing) of that departure - were unusual or se\n. suspicious in any way. He expressed his belief that the; probably were :\nnot and cited Soviet relaxation in such matters jn the post-Stalinera. — :\n: However, he war.ted to be sure in his own mird that our information was : .\n. not in conflict with that which the Commissior: had received from State\n' since all of that information would remain in tee records of the\nCommission. ; . , :\n. 3. After stating my belief that. there was x9 real disagreement or\ninconsistency betueen the information from CLA and that from State, I ‘\n‘expressed the view that the matter resolved itseif into three questions: ; ,\n, _ fa.

Mr. Slawson commented\n; that this explanation was most helpful and he reread what both we and\nState had said in that light.\n5. By way of further explanation, I said that the statements in\n; paragraph 6 of our memorandum of 6 April 1964 concerning Soviets being\n. permitted to accompany their foreign spouses abroad were based on a\nreview of 26 cases, of which 10 involved Americans. . In only four of ~\nthese cascs did a Soviet wife leave the USSR in the company of ner foreign :\n. husband; in 14 of the cases the foreign spouse departed alone; and in the\n, ' remaining seven cases insufficient details are known to permit us to\ncategorize them. I added that although State's information began by |\nciting the issuance of 724 quota and non-quota immigrant visas by the. ; ,\nAmerican Embassy in Moscow during the period FY 1954 to December\n1903, it did not indicate how many of these visas were for Soviet citizens :\n, who had married U.S. nationals.

Assassination of President Kennedy at 1400 hours on tris date in\nthe Commission's offices at 200 Maryland Avenue, N.E., Washington, ~\n. D.C. The purpsse of this meeting was to discuss apparent inconsistencies -\nin material provided the Commission by CIA asd ty the Departmens of ;\nState which were called to our attention in a letter from the General :\nCounsel of the Cummission to Mr. Helms, dated 3 July 1964. :\n2. By way of introduction, Mr. Slawson said that in the portion of the | -\nCommission's report that he was writing, he sould have to deal with the 7\nquestion of whett.er or not the OSWALDs! depzrture {rom the USSR = and ;\n‘the circumstances {i.e. timing) of that departure - were unusual or se\n. suspicious in any way. He expressed his belief that the; probably were :\nnot and cited Soviet relaxation in such matters jn the post-Stalinera. — :\n: However, he war.ted to be sure in his own mird that our information was : .\n. not in conflict with that which the Commissior: had received from State\n' since all of that information would remain in tee records of the\nCommission. ; . , :\n. 3. After stating my belief that. there was x9 real disagreement or\ninconsistency betueen the information from CLA and that from State, I ‘\n‘expressed the view that the matter resolved itseif into three questions: ; ,\n, _ fa. Do the Soviet :\nOocument Number 161-36 4 ; oy\n; for FOIA Review on JUN 1876 es topy ; a ;\nCUA\". - Stnef CARMAN GE\n\n## Page 2\n\n13-00000 vo\n, . — a. Do the Soviet authorities normally permit Soviet :\na “eltizens married tu forcign nationals to emigrate from the — ne\n_ Soviet Union tq the homelands of their spouses? so\noe ~ 7 ‘b. | Do they normally permit such Soviet citizens to. , .\n: : accompany (i.e. depart simultaneously with) their spouses \"lov :\n7 from the Soviet Union? . EF SO,\n. L ; c. How long does it take such Soviet citizens to get ~ :\n. Soviet exit visas for such a purpose (time lapse from application :\n_ | to granting of visas)? . ,\n) 4. Concerning the first two questions Qa and 3b above) I pointed out . “tg\n__- that we had addressed ourselves mainly to the question of Soviet citizens \"|\n_ being allowed to accompany their spouses abroad while State dealt only\n. with the larger question of Sovicts married to foreigners being ailowed\n. to emigrate without reference to whetner or not they left simultazeously\n. with or at another time from their spouses. Mr. Slawson commented\n; that this explanation was most helpful and he reread what both we and\nState had said in that light.\n5. By way of further explanation, I said that the statements in\n; paragraph 6 of our memorandum of 6 April 1964 concerning Soviets being\n. permitted to accompany their foreign spouses abroad were based on a\nreview of 26 cases, of which 10 involved Americans. . In only four of ~\nthese cascs did a Soviet wife leave the USSR in the company of ner foreign :\n. husband; in 14 of the cases the foreign spouse departed alone; and in the\n, ' remaining seven cases insufficient details are known to permit us to\ncategorize them. I added that although State's information began by |\nciting the issuance of 724 quota and non-quota immigrant visas by the. ; ,\nAmerican Embassy in Moscow during the period FY 1954 to December\n1903, it did not indicate how many of these visas were for Soviet citizens :\n, who had married U.S. nationals. Actually State provided detailed\ninformation for only sixteen cases and did not indicate in many of these\n, whether or not the Soviet was permitted to accompany the foreign spouse.\n) , /6. In response to .\n\n## Page 3\n\n13-00000\nso \" 6. In response ts a question from Mr. Slawsoa I stated that most\ns of the 26 cases upon which we based Gur statements involved foreign\n’ students, exchange teachers and other relatively transient persons, .\n— , and while a number of cases have certain points im common, they bear\n; ; ‘little similarity to the OSWALD case in that none imvolved a defector who -\n; : married prior to rcpatriating. Inoted that paragraph 6 of our 6 April\n: : 1964 memorandum to the Commission had pointed this out. Mr. Slawson\ni ‘indicated that hg was now satisfied on this matter. voy ; ot\n‘ 7. Concerning the length of time taken by Soviet authorities to_\n. , process exit visas for Soviet citizens married to foreign nationals — _\n(question 3c above), I stated that, in my vupinion, the information “Sy\n7 provided by State (in the third enclosure to Mr. Meeker's letter) . .\nsubstantially corresponded to the views expressed in paragraphs 6 and 7 -\nof our memorandum to the Commission dated 6 April 1964. Mr. Slawson\n| asked if it would be possible to elaborate paragraph 7 of our memorandum\nof 6 April by providing 2 statistical breakdown of the cases on which our\nstatements were based. ] indicated that this could be done. .\n, 8. At this point Mr. Slawson stated that as a result of our discussion _\nhe felt that the question of possible inconsistenciés had been resolved. oe\n- However, he asked that «e send a brief written reply to the Commission's\n\nletter of 3 July 1964 embodying the substance of what [had said concerning\nthe basis for statements included in our 6 April 1964 memorandum. [This\nwould include the gist of the draft reply to the Commission which I showed -\nto C/SR on 8 July plus an elaboration of our statements concerning Soviet\n; visa applications. ] ,\n. 9. Mr. Slawson indicated that he would be sending parts of his report\n‘ dealing with the Sovict inteHigence services to CIA for checking as to\ntheir accuracy. ‘He did nut say when this would ocaar.\n10.
